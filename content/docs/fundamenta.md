# Fundamenta

The fundamentals of Faber: program structure, variable bindings, literals, output, and patterns. These are the building blocks upon which all Faber programs rest. Understanding them means understanding how Faber uses Latin's clarity to make programming concepts visible.

## Program Structure

Every Faber program needs an entry point. This is where execution begins, and Faber provides two forms depending on whether your program is synchronous or asynchronous.

### Synchronous Entry: incipit

The keyword `incipit` marks the synchronous entry point. It is the third person singular present active indicative of *incipere* (to begin): "it begins."

```fab
incipit {
    scribe "Salve, Munde!"
}
```

This is the simplest possible Faber program. The `incipit` block contains the statements that execute when the program runs. Functions and types defined outside `incipit` become module-level declarations that the entry point can call.

```fab
functio greet(textus name) -> textus {
    redde scriptum("Salve, §!", name)
}

incipit {
    scribe greet("Marcus")
}
```

### Asynchronous Entry: incipiet

When your program needs to perform asynchronous operations at the top level, use `incipiet` instead. This is the future tense: "it will begin." The naming mirrors the `fit`/`fiet` pattern used throughout Faber, where present tense indicates synchronous operations and future tense indicates asynchronous ones.

```fab
incipiet {
    figendum data = fetchData()
    scribe data
}
```

Inside an `incipiet` block, you can use `figendum` and `variandum` (the async binding forms) directly, or use `cede` (yield/await) with regular bindings.

## Variables

Faber distinguishes between mutable and immutable bindings with distinct keywords. This explicitness is a core design principle: the reader should know at a glance whether a value can change.

### Immutable Bindings: fixum

The keyword `fixum` declares an immutable binding. It is the perfect passive participle of *figere* (to fix, fasten): "that which has been fixed." Once bound, a `fixum` value cannot be reassigned.

```fab
fixum greeting = "Salve, Mundus!"
fixum x = 10
fixum y = 20
fixum sum = x + y
```

Immutable bindings are the default choice in Faber. They communicate intent clearly: this value will not change for the remainder of its scope. Prefer `fixum` unless you have a specific reason for mutability.

Type annotations are optional when the type can be inferred, but you can be explicit:

```fab
fixum numerus age = 30
fixum textus name = "Marcus"
fixum bivalens active = verum
```

The pattern is always type-first: `fixum <type> <name> = <value>`. This mirrors Latin's adjective-noun ordering and distinguishes Faber from languages that place types after names.

### Mutable Bindings: varia

The keyword `varia` declares a mutable binding. It comes from *variare* (to vary): "let it vary." A `varia` binding can be reassigned throughout its scope.

```fab
varia counter = 0
scribe counter       # 0

counter = 1
scribe counter       # 1

counter = counter + 10
scribe counter       # 11
```

Use `varia` when a value genuinely needs to change, such as loop counters, accumulators, or state that evolves over time.

```fab
varia numerus count = 0
varia textus status = "pending"
varia bivalens running = falsum

count = 100
status = "complete"
running = verum
```

### Async Bindings: figendum and variandum

Faber provides async-aware binding forms that combine declaration with awaiting. These use the Latin gerundive, a verbal adjective expressing necessity or obligation.

`figendum` means "that which must be fixed." It declares an immutable binding whose value comes from an asynchronous operation:

```fab
figendum result = fetchData()
```

`variandum` means "that which must be varied." It declares a mutable binding from an async source:

```fab
variandum data = loadConfig()
data = transform(data)
```

These forms are syntactic conveniences equivalent to using `cede` (await) with regular bindings, but they make the async nature visible at declaration time.

## Literals

Faber supports the standard literal types with Latin keywords for boolean and null values.

### Numbers

Integers and floating-point numbers use standard notation:

```fab
fixum integer = 42
fixum decimal = 3.14
fixum negative = -100
```

For typed declarations, `numerus` is the integer type and `fractus` (from *frangere*, to break) is the floating-point type:

```fab
fixum numerus count = 42
fixum fractus rate = 0.05
```

### Strings

Strings can use either double or single quotes:

```fab
fixum greeting = "hello"
fixum single = 'single quotes'
```

Template literals use backticks with `${...}` interpolation, following the familiar JavaScript pattern:

```fab
fixum name = "Mundus"
fixum message = `Hello ${name}`
```

### Booleans: verum and falsum

Rather than `true` and `false`, Faber uses Latin: `verum` (true, real) and `falsum` (false, deceptive). These are not arbitrary choices. Latin's *verum* shares its root with English "verify" and "veracity"; *falsum* gives us "falsify."

```fab
fixum yes = verum
fixum no = falsum
fixum bivalens active = verum
```

The type `bivalens` (two-valued) names what a boolean is: a value that can be one of exactly two states.

### Null: nihil

The absence of a value is expressed as `nihil` (nothing). This is clearer than symbols like `null` or `nil` that have become so familiar we no longer notice their meaning.

```fab
fixum nothing = nihil
```

## Output

Faber provides three output statements corresponding to different severity levels. These are imperative forms that write to the console.

### Standard Output: scribe

The keyword `scribe` writes to standard output. It is the imperative of *scribere* (to write): "write!"

```fab
scribe "Hello, world!"
```

Multiple arguments are printed space-separated:

```fab
fixum nomen = "Marcus"
fixum aetas = 30
scribe "Name:", nomen
scribe "Age:", aetas
scribe "Coordinates:", x, y
```

### Debug Output: vide

The keyword `vide` writes to debug output. It is the imperative of *videre* (to see): "see!" Use it for diagnostic information that should be visible during development but filtered in production.

```fab
vide "Debug: entering main loop"
vide "Debug: count =", count
```

### Warning Output: mone

The keyword `mone` writes to warning output. It is the imperative of *monere* (to warn, advise): "warn!" Use it for conditions that are not errors but deserve attention.

```fab
mone "Warning: deprecated feature used"
mone "Warning: count exceeds threshold:", count
```

## Comments

Comments begin with `#` and extend to the end of the line. There is no block comment syntax.

```fab
# This is a comment
fixum x = 10  # inline comment
```

Comments explain *why*, not *what*. The code itself shows what is happening; comments provide context that cannot be derived from the code alone.

## Destructuring

Faber provides patterns for extracting values from objects and arrays. The syntax uses `ex` (from, out of) to indicate the source and the binding keyword to indicate mutability.

### Object Destructuring

To extract properties from an object, use `ex <source> fixum <properties>`:

```fab
fixum person = { name: "Marcus", age: 30, city: "Roma" }
ex person fixum name, age

scribe name   # "Marcus"
scribe age    # 30
```

Use `ut` (as) to rename properties during extraction:

```fab
fixum user = { name: "Julia", email: "julia@roma.com" }
ex user fixum name ut userName, email ut userEmail

scribe userName    # "Julia"
scribe userEmail   # "julia@roma.com"
```

Use `varia` instead of `fixum` for mutable bindings:

```fab
fixum data = { count: 100, active: verum }
ex data varia count, active

count = 200
active = falsum
```

The rest pattern `ceteri` (the rest, the others) collects remaining properties:

```fab
fixum fullUser = { id: 1, name: "Gaius", email: "g@roma.com", role: "admin" }
ex fullUser fixum id, ceteri details

scribe id       # 1
scribe details  # { name: "Gaius", email: "g@roma.com", role: "admin" }
```

### Array Destructuring

Arrays use bracket notation in the pattern:

```fab
fixum numbers = [1, 2, 3]
fixum [a, b, c] = numbers

scribe a  # 1
scribe b  # 2
scribe c  # 3
```

Partial destructuring extracts only what you need:

```fab
fixum values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
fixum [one, two] = values

scribe one  # 1
scribe two  # 2
```

The underscore `_` skips elements:

```fab
fixum triple = [10, 20, 30]
fixum [_, middle, _] = triple

scribe middle  # 20
```

The rest pattern works with arrays too:

```fab
fixum items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
fixum [head, ceteri tail] = items

scribe head  # 1
scribe tail  # [2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Mutable array destructuring uses `varia`:

```fab
fixum coords = [100, 200]
varia [x, y] = coords

x = x + 50
y = y + 50

scribe x  # 150
scribe y  # 250
```

These fundamentals are the vocabulary and grammar of Faber. With them, you can write clear, expressive programs. The more advanced features documented elsewhere build upon this foundation, but these basics are sufficient for substantial work.
